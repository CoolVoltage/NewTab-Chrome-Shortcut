# NewTab-Chrome-Shortcut
Because trackpads don't have a middle mouse button to open a link in new tab. And i don't like to press ctrl or cmd everytime.

#So the solution?
Double click on a link to open in a new tab.

#Installing
* Clone the repo or download the zip.
* Go to chrome://extensions.
* Switch on developer mode.
* Click on load unpacked extension and select the codebase.

#Updating
* Pull the necessary updates.
* Go to chome://extensions.
* Click on reload extension.

## Why is it not on Chrome app store?
Good question! I am lazy.

## Do you think it should be?
Nice! Send a pull request with the necessary changes.
